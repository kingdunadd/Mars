#### **`i3`** is a next-generation inventory for Minetest.

This inventory offers a slick, modern UI made with the latest technologies of the Minetest engine.
**`i3`** provides a rich [**API**](https://github.com/minetest-mods/i3/blob/master/API.md) for mod developers who want to extend it.

This mod requires **Minetest 5.4+**

#### List of features:
   - Crafting Guide (only in survival mode)
   - Progressive Mode¹
   - Quick Crafting
   - Backpacks
   - 3D Player Model Preview
   - Inventory Sorting (alphabetical + item stack compression)
   - Item Bookmarks
   - Waypoints

**¹** *This mode is a Terraria-like system that shows recipes you can craft from items you ever had in your inventory.
To enable it: `i3_progressive_mode = true` in `minetest.conf`.*


#### This mod officially supports the following mods:
   - [**`3d_armor`**](https://content.minetest.net/packages/stu/3d_armor/)
   - [**`skinsdb`**](https://content.minetest.net/packages/bell07/skinsdb/)
   - [**`awards`**](https://content.minetest.net/packages/rubenwardy/awards/)

#### Recommendations

To use this mod in the best conditions, it's recommended to follow these recommendations:

   - Use LuaJIT
   - Use a HiDPI widescreen display
   - Use the default Freetype font style

#### Notes

`i3` uses a larger inventory than the usual inventories in Minetest games.
Thus, most chests will be unadapted to this inventory size.
The `i3`  inventory is 9 slots wide by default (without backpack), such as in Minecraft.
